How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It highlights areas of difference in order to focus the manual search, ignoring areas that are the same between versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Able to track changes, see edits other people made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Able to publish at natural stopping points. Also decreases the number of previous versions to better track changes between meaningful iterations.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Depends on design intent. Google docs is likely designed for un-related documents, where a system designed for coding like Git is designed to handle multiple related files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to see commit history, and use git diff to compare two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Being able to try something knowing that you can go back is less risky. Also can readily find the exact change that broke something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Double check that git log still works on asteroids.
